1. The compilation is the process of converting the source code of the C language into machine code.
The first step is creating a C source file: We first create a C program using an editor and save the file as filename.c
the second step is compiling using the gcc compiler: We use the following command in the terminal for compiling our filename.c source file
The third step is executing the program: After compilation executable is generated and we run the generated executable using the below command.

2.Assembler interprets computer programmes written in assembly language and convert it into machine code.
In this phase the filename.s is taken as input and turned into filename.o by the assembler. This file contains machine-level instructions. At this phase, only existing code is converted into machine language, and the function calls like printf() are not resolved

3. when you install a program on a computer, the program is copied to your hard disk. But when you excute the program, the program is copied/ loaded from your hard disk to the main memory and the copy of that program is excuted.
